Took six top-level and turned them into five DIVs and one FOOTER. Inside of each of those six panels, and further boxed up their content into further HTML elements. This content is logically ordered, properly marked up, and now ready to be styled. Gave each of the six top-level boxes class attributes, which is used as selectors in the stylesheet.

Used CSS to make a webpage that looks pretty similar to the mockup The Designer gave us.

Used CSS comments to mark where generalized styles where made for the pages and where panel-specific styles were made. The generalized styles are helpful because if a color scheme gets changed, we only have to change the colors in a few places instead of tracking them down all over the page.

Made use of various kinds of selectors, including multiple selectors and descendant selectors.
